## 🎯 Main Goal

The primary objective of this project is to provide students with:  
✅ A **practical understanding** of microservices concepts.  
✅ Experience in **service decomposition, inter-service communication, and scalability**.  
✅ Hands-on training with **modern tools and frameworks** used in microservices development.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts

Throughout the training, students will work with:

- **Spring Boot / Node.js** (for microservices implementation)
- **API Gateway & Service Discovery**
- **Message Brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)**
- **Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)**
- **Database Management (SQL/NoSQL)**
- **Security with Keycloak (Authentication & Authorization)**
- **Frontend with Angular Framework**

## 📅 Training Duration

**30 hours** of guided learning and project development.

## 🚀 Learning Outcome

By the end of this training, students will be able to **design, develop, and deploy scalable and secure microservices
applications**, preparing them for real-world software architecture challenges.
